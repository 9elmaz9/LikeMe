## Demo
You can see the project in action [here](https://9elmaz9.github.io/LikeMe/). Double-click on the image to see the heart animation and the like counter increase.

## Description
The **Double Click Heart** project is a simple and fun web application that allows users to express their appreciation by double-clicking on an image. Each double-click generates a heart animation on the image and increments a counter displaying the total number of likes.

- **Like Counter**: Keeps track of how many times the image has been liked.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity (double-click detection and heart animation).
